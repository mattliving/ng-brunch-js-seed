# angular-brunch-seed-javascript
### A starter project for AngularJS using Brunch.io

[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) + [Brunch](http://brunch.io)

Features:
* Javascript / Jade ready / Less / SASS / SCSS / Stylus automatically compiled on save
* auto-reload during development saves you from manually refreshing the page
* Javascript / CSS minification for production
* [testacular](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular) integration for
  unit tests
* Bootstrap integration with themes.

## Alternate Versions

- [Coffeescript] (https://github.com/scotch/angular-brunch-seed) by [@scotch](https://github.com/scotch) - Uses [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) instead of Javascript and [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) instead of HTML
- [Livescript](https://github.com/clkao/angular-brunch-seed-livescript) by [@clkao](https://github.com/clkao) - Uses [Livescript](http://livescript.net/) instead of [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/)
- [True North](https://github.com/scoarescoare/angular-brunch-true-north) by [@scoarescoare](https://github.com/scoarescoare) - Uses [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) instead of [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
- [Bower Support](https://github.com/GulinSS/angular-brunch-seed) by [@GulinSS](https://github.com/GulinSS) - Uses [Bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower) for package management

## How to use angular-brunch-seed

* `git clone https://github.com/Nss/angular-brunch-seed-javascript.git` to clone the **angular-brunch-seed-javascript** repository
* `cd angular-brunch-seed-javascript`
* `./scripts/init.sh` to install node packages

or if you have **Brunch** installed run:

`brunch new myapp --skeleton https://github.com/Nss/angular-brunch-seed-javascript`


### Using html

By default angular-brunch-seed-javascript uses html templates. If you would translate your jade file to HTML run the command:

```
./scripts/compile-html.sh
```
All Jade file will be compiled to HTML and be placed in the `app/assets` directory. Addtionally, the `*.jade` files will be removed from the project. Any changes that you make to the `app/assets/**/*.html` files will now appear in the browser.


### Using Jade

You could put the jade files in the `app` and `app/partials` directories. Upon save the Jade files will be compiled to HTML and placed in the `app/assets` folder. Do not modify the files in the `app/assets` folder as they will be overriden with subsequent changes to their `*.jade` counter part.


### Running the app during development

* `./scripts/server.sh` to serve using **Brunch**

Then navigate your browser to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)

NOTE: Occasionally the scripts will not load properly on the initial
load. If this occurs, refresh the page. Subsequent refresh will render
correctly.

### Running the app in production

* `./scripts/production.sh` to minify javascript and css files.

Please be aware of the caveats regarding Angular JS and minification, take a look at [Dependency Injection](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di) for information.

### Running unit tests

* `./scripts/test.sh` to run unit tests with [testacular](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular)
* Open the browser you would like to test to [http://localhost:3334](http://localhost:3334)

Notes:

- Testacular will run tests on save. To insure that changes are
saved be sure to have `./script/server.sh` or `./script/development.sh` running in the console.
- If you are on OS X you set the browsers that you would like to target
  in the `/test/testacular_conf.js` file E.g. `browser = ["ChromeCanary", "Firefox"]`

### End to end testing

* run the app in development mode as described above using a separate terminal
* `./scripts/test-e2e.sh` to run e2e tests with [testacular](https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular) using angular's scenario runner

### Common issues

Initial load does not render correctly; scripts are not loading. 
- Occasionally the scripts will not load properly on the initial 
  load. If this occurs, refresh the page. Subsequent refresh will render
  correctly.

`EMFILE` error
- EMFILE means there are too many open files. Brunch watches all your project files and it's usually a pretty big number. You can fix this error with setting max opened file count to bigger number with command ulimit -n <number> (10000 should be enough).

### Receiving updates from upstream

When we upgrade angular-seed's repo with newer angular or testing library code, you can just
fetch the changes and merge them into your project with git.

`git pull origin master`
